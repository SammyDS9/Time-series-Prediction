# Time-series-Prediction: Built a Time series model to predict Admision of patients in Hospital. For HIPPA issues i have used a randomly generated data set.
# I created multiple time series model and evalueteed that best fits the model EMA 

From the SARIMA model we built with synthetic data, we aimed to forecast patient readmissions for future months. Let's extract some key insights and possible utility from such a model for your stakeholders:

### End Result
1. **Forecast**: The model provided forecasts of patient readmissions for several future points (the number of readmissions expected in the upcoming months). 

2. **Model Performance**: Through various metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE) and visualizations, we assessed how well the model is likely to perform, indicating the reliability of our forecasts.

3. **Residual Diagnostics**: Analyzing residuals, we got insights into whether there’s a pattern the model might be missing, providing a path for further model improvement.

### Utility for Stakeholders

#### A. Hospital Administrators
- **Resource Allocation**: Predicting peaks in readmissions allows administrators to adequately allocate resources, such as staffing and bed availability, to handle the increased patient load.
  
- **Budget Planning**: Forecasting readmissions might highlight periods where higher operational costs might be incurred, aiding in effective budget planning.

- **Strategy Development**: If certain periods consistently show higher readmissions, targeted intervention strategies (like post-discharge follow-up programs) could be developed.

#### B. Clinical Teams
- **Patient Care**: Understanding when higher readmissions are expected, clinical teams can enhance post-discharge care strategies to potentially mitigate these readmissions.

- **Staffing**: Insights into expected readmission can guide staffing decisions, ensuring that there are adequate healthcare professionals during peak times.

#### C. Data and Analytics Teams
- **Model Improvement**: Continuous model evaluation provides a path for tweaking and improving the model, making it a robust tool for future predictions.
  
- **In-depth Analysis**: Further analysis can be conducted to understand why certain periods might have higher readmissions, uncovering underlying causes or trends.

#### D. Policy Makers
- **Policy Development**: If certain policies are resulting in frequent readmissions, these can be reviewed and revised to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

- **Community Engagement**: Strategies to engage the community, especially during high readmission periods, can be developed to enhance patient education and support.

### Conclusion
The SARIMA model, through its forecasts, provides a forward-looking view, enabling stakeholders to plan and strategize effectively to manage patient readmissions. It becomes a tool that, if used effectively, can enhance operational efficiency, improve patient care, and potentially uncover areas for strategic improvement in patient management post-discharge.

In practical scenarios, it’s crucial to continuously validate and refine the model with new data, ensuring its predictive power remains robust. Also, integrating domain expert insights into model refinement and strategy development is key to ensuring its practical applicability and effectiveness.
